 I have created a simple Chat-Application where -:

 
 If  two or more user's want to chat with eachother then.
 ->The person must enter the username and the roomId and  
 -> when these two credentials are filled a mini chat will be displayed
 or else it won't be displayed.
 
 Note :-

 -> By default React runs at port(localhost:/5173).
 -> open two or more tabs on the same port( http://localhost:5173/) 
 -> Remember the users should Enter the same RoomId
 
 Example-: (like username1 = 123(roomId)  in one tab
 then username2 = 123(roomID) in another tab)
 
 -> then  connection will be established 
 and the user's can chat with each-other.
  To  run Back-end -> go to cd back-end and run => nodemon index.js
  To  run Front-End go to cd chat-app and run => npm run dev.
