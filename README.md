 i have crated  a  simple Chat-Application where -:

 
 If  two or more user's want to chat with eachother than
 ->The person must enter the username and the roomId and  
 -> when these two credantails are filled a mini chat will be displayed
 or else it won't be displayed.
 Note :-

 -> By default React runs at port(localhost:/5173).
 -> open as many tabs on the same port( http://localhost:5173/) 
 -> Remember Both the users should Enter the same RoomId
 Example-: (like username1 = 123roomId  in one tab
 then username2 = 123 roomID in another tab)
 -> then  connection will be established 
 and the user's can chat with each-other
